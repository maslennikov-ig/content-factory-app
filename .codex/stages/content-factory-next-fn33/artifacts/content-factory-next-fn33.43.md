# Summary

The sign-in form printed the response body, so a Russian page answered «Invalid user name or password». It goes through the shared helper now, and the raw text goes to the console.

Two branches still read the server's English: «User is awaiting approval» and «User is not activated». `inactiveReason()` distinguishes them by text alone, and neither string reaches the screen — each selects a panel with its own translated copy and its own way onward. A change on the server therefore costs a translated fallback, not an English sentence.

# Scope / Routing

Stream H1 of the 04.09.2026 wave: the sign-in, registration and invitation screens. Write zone as
declared above. No documentation source was needed — every decision here is settled by the
repository's own code and the design rules already in it.

# Verification

Every command below was run in this worktree on Node 22.23.2.

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p apps/frontend/tsconfig.json: passed`
- `pnpm exec jest tests/auth-form-errors.test.cjs tests/register-invitation-landing.test.cjs tests/auth-language-choice.test.cjs: passed`
- `pnpm exec jest tests/design.guard.test.cjs tests/design.contrast.test.cjs tests/foundation.test.cjs tests/locale-key-set.test.cjs tests/locale-translated.test.cjs: passed`
- `pnpm exec jest <39 suites touching the changed files>: passed (527 tests)`

The three new suites were run against the unchanged sources first and failed there; they pass with
the change in place.

# Delivery / Cleanup

Returned on the stream branch for the root to merge. Nothing was pushed and no bead was closed.

# Risks / Follow-ups / Explicit Defers

- Those two matches stay fragile until the backend answers with codes, which is outside this write zone. Recorded here rather than fixed quietly.

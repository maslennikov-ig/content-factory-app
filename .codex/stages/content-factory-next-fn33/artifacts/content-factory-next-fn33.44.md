# Summary

The hint and the refusal are the same sentence, and both were shown — once grey, once red. The refusal now replaces the hint it repeats.

The crowding is separate: the fields sat in a `flex flex-col` with no gap, so the reserved message row under one field touched the label of the next. The registration and sign-in forms space their fields now. The `Input` primitive itself was not changed — it is outside this write zone, and it was not the defect: its own message row is already a reserved, spaced element.

# Scope / Routing

Stream H1 of the 04.09.2026 wave: the sign-in, registration and invitation screens. Write zone as
declared above. No documentation source was needed — every decision here is settled by the
repository's own code and the design rules already in it.

# Verification

Every command below was run in this worktree on Node 22.23.2.

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p apps/frontend/tsconfig.json: passed`
- `pnpm exec jest tests/auth-form-errors.test.cjs tests/register-invitation-landing.test.cjs tests/auth-language-choice.test.cjs: passed`
- `pnpm exec jest tests/design.guard.test.cjs tests/design.contrast.test.cjs tests/foundation.test.cjs tests/locale-key-set.test.cjs tests/locale-translated.test.cjs: passed`
- `pnpm exec jest <39 suites touching the changed files>: passed (527 tests)`

The three new suites were run against the unchanged sources first and failed there; they pass with
the change in place.

# Delivery / Cleanup

Returned on the stream branch for the root to merge. Nothing was pushed and no bead was closed.

# Risks / Follow-ups / Explicit Defers

- None outstanding.

# Summary

The special case had been written for noon only, so the column began at «0:00 AM» — an hour that does not exist in the notation it is written in.

# Scope / Routing

Write zone as listed above; no file outside it was touched except the sixteen
locale dictionaries, the design geometry ledger and this artifact. No external
documentation was needed: every decision here is a local repository behaviour.

# Verification

- pnpm exec jest tests/calendar.reader-notation.test.cjs: passed (11)

Each new assertion was seen failing against the unfixed source before it passed.

# Delivery / Cleanup

Returned on `worktree-agent-ac8079e5073a62a65` for the root to merge into `wave/fixes-2026-09-04`.

# Risks / Follow-ups / Explicit Defers

None beyond the shared notes in the stream report.
